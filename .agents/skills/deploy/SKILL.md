name: deploy
description: Apply this checkout to the running machine by switching the local NixOS configuration with a privileged `nixos-rebuild switch --flake .`. Use when the user explicitly asks to deploy, or when a completed configuration change (package, version, or setting) needs to be applied and the user confirms it.
---

# Deploy the local machine

Build and activate this checkout on the machine you are running on. Elevate through `pkexec`; never use `nh`, and never target a remote host from this skill.

## When to run

Deploy only with one of these triggers:

- The user explicitly asks to deploy, apply, or switch to the current configuration. That request is the authorization; still state the machine and command before running it.
- A task the user requested is finished and only takes effect after activation — a package version bump, a new package, a configuration change. Ask the user whether to deploy it now and wait for agreement.

Do not deploy on your own initiative, for a remote machine (use `just rdeploy <machine> <target>` or the [install-machine](../install-machine/SKILL.md) skill), while the change is incomplete or fails to evaluate, or as a way to reach unrelated privileged operations such as `boot`, `gc`, or secret rewrites.

## Prepare

1. `hostname` must match the machine this checkout configures; the command builds and activates the local system only.
2. Stage new files with `git add`. Nix evaluates a flake from the git tree and ignores untracked files, so an unstaged new module would silently not apply.
3. Format with `nixfmt`, lint with `statix`, and evaluate the local configuration. Never switch to a configuration that does not evaluate.
4. Commit the completed change at its atomic point (see [AGENTS.md](../../../AGENTS.md)) so the deployed revision is identifiable; `nixos-rebuild` otherwise warns about a dirty tree.

## Switch

```sh
pkexec --keep-cwd /run/current-system/sw/bin/env PATH="$PATH" nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
```

- Run it from the repository root. `--keep-cwd` is required: without it `pkexec` changes to the target user's home directory (`/root`) and `.` is no longer the checkout.
- Pass the session `PATH` through `env`. `pkexec` replaces the environment with a safe list that contains no `git`, and Nix resolves `git` from `PATH` to fetch flake inputs that are not yet in the privileged fetcher cache. Without this the switch aborts with `executing "git": No such file or directory` while fetching a transitive input such as `smithay`.
- Elevate with `pkexec`, not `sudo` or `nixos-rebuild --sudo`, and do not substitute `nh` or the `just deploy` recipe, which runs `nh`.
- Expect the polkit authentication dialog; the whole command then runs as root. The `nixos-rebuild-ng` wrapper supplies its own tools, so the rest of the reduced privileged environment is sufficient.
- If the command reports `pkexec must be setuid root`, a sandbox is blocking setuid escalation; rerun it unsandboxed.

## Report

- Report the generation that was activated (`nixos-rebuild list-generations`) and which changes are now live.
- A successful switch proves evaluation and activation, not runtime behavior. State what still needs verification, especially services, drivers, hardware, and secrets.
