# Standalone Nix package for the DeepSeek Harness desktop application.

#
# Why this is a separate package and not a second output of
# deepseek-harness-git: Nix builds every output of a derivation in one builder
# invocation. Measured on a probe derivation with outputs = [ "out" "desktop" ]
# whose desktop output referenced a unique throwaway dependency, `nix build
# ...out` printed "these 2 derivations will be built" and built that
# desktop-only dependency as well. A second output would therefore make every
# plain `nix build .#deepseek-harness-git` fetch a 360 MiB Electron and run the
# desktop installPhase. Keeping the two separate means CLI/Web users never touch
# Electron. (The two outputs' *runtime closures* are in fact independent; it is
# the build cost, not closure size, that forces the split.)
#
# Only the desktop assembly is new here; this file documents the on-disk layout
# and the four load-bearing details, each verified against the unmodified
# upstream application.
# Desktop assembly notes.
#
# Layout, relative to the output root:
#
#   deepseek-harness                            the Electron binary
#   resources/app/                              app.getAppPath()
#   resources/app/dsh/                          the bundled dsh runtime
#   resources/app/dsh/desktop-runtime.json      runtime descriptor
#   resources/runtime/office-skills/            boot-required skill assets
#   resources/runtime/bin/node                  standalone Node for skill-office
#   resources/runtime/pnpm/                     pnpm CLI
#   resources/runtime/primary-runtime/          interpreters + Python libraries
#   resources/icon.png                          window/taskbar icon
#
# Four details are load-bearing; each was verified experimentally against the
# unmodified upstream application.
#
#  1. The Electron binary must NOT be named 'electron'. Electron treats an
#     executable by that name as "the default app" and reports
#     app.isPackaged === false, which sends main.ts down its development branch.
#     Verified on identical trees: renamed -> isPackaged true, untouched -> false.
#
#  2. The bundled runtime lives at resources/app/dsh, not resources/dsh.
#     runtimeResources() (apps/desktop/src/main.ts) resolves the packaged path as
#     join(app.getAppPath(), 'dsh'), and upstream's electron-builder config packs
#     'dsh' *inside* the asar ({ from: dsh, to: 'dsh' }). This package ships no
#     asar, so app.getAppPath() is resources/app and the runtime sits beneath it.
#     With the runtime anywhere else the binary still starts, then dies later on
#     a missing desktop-runtime.json.
#
#  3. desktop-runtime.json is only partly validated at launch, which is why this
#     package checks it at build time instead. The reader the shipped shell runs
#     (readDesktopRuntime, inlined into lib/main.js) hard-fails unless both
#     @deepseek-ai/dsh and @deepseek-ai/dsh-desktop-host appear in sharedPackages
#     carrying exactly release.version, and unless release.nodeVersion and
#     release.pnpmVersion are semver strings. It does NOT compare
#     release.hostProtocolVersion, and it treats the 'files' inventory as
#     structural only: the byte-level integrity sweep and the protocol-generation
#     comparison both live in verifyDesktopRuntime, which upstream runs while
#     packaging and which never runs at launch. So an empty 'files' array is
#     legal (the store hash is a stronger guarantee), the protocol field is
#     informational at runtime, and a stale protocol or Node version would be
#     accepted silently. Both are therefore derived at build time (see 3a in the
#     install phase) rather than written down here.
#
#  4. Three environment details are load-bearing; the wrapper sets all three.
#     CHROME_DEVEL_SANDBOX points Chromium at its setuid sandbox helper, exactly
#     as nixpkgs' own electron wrapper does. Without it the process dies on
#     SIGILL before printing anything, and the only alternative is --no-sandbox,
#     which disables the sandbox outright. LD_LIBRARY_PATH must carry libstdc++,
#     because N-API addons are dlopen()ed out of a per-user cache directory
#     (node-addon-native-custom-loader copies them out of the store first), so
#     they do not inherit the Electron binary's RPATH; without it the Host aborts
#     with "No usable native binding found for
#     node-addon-require-builtin-linux-x64-gnu".
#
#     PATH additionally carries bubblewrap, because dsh's own platform sandbox
#     probes for it first on Linux (chain: bwrap, then landlock) and refuses to
#     run a command unconfined when neither backend is usable. The landlock
#     launcher's optional platform package is not materialized by the offline
#     pnpm install, so without bwrap every workspace-write command fails with
#     SANDBOX_UNAVAILABLE and the desktop app can only ask for escalation.
#     Electron's chrome-sandbox is unrelated: it confines renderers, not the
#     commands the model runs.
