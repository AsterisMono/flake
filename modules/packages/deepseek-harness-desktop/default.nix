# Standalone Nix package for the DeepSeek Harness desktop application.

#
# Why this is a separate package and not a second output of
# deepseek-harness-git: Nix builds every output of a derivation in one builder
# invocation. Measured on a probe derivation with outputs = [ "out" "desktop" ]
# whose desktop output referenced a unique throwaway dependency, `nix build
# ...out` printed "these 2 derivations will be built" and built that
# desktop-only dependency as well. A second output would therefore make every
# plain `nix build .#deepseek-harness-git` fetch a 360 MiB Electron and run the
# desktop installPhase. Keeping the two separate means CLI/Web users never touch
# Electron. (The two outputs' *runtime closures* are in fact independent; it is
# the build cost, not closure size, that forces the split.)
#
# Only the desktop assembly is new here; this file documents the on-disk layout
# and the five load-bearing details, each verified against the unmodified
# upstream application. Note 6 is this package's one deliberate deviation from
# that application.
# Desktop assembly notes.
#
# Layout, relative to the output root:
#
#   deepseek-harness                            the Electron binary
#   resources/app/                              app.getAppPath()
#   resources/app/dsh/                          the bundled dsh runtime
#   resources/app/dsh/desktop-runtime.json      runtime descriptor
#   resources/runtime/office-skills/            boot-required skill assets
#   resources/runtime/bin/node                  standalone Node for skill-office
#   resources/runtime/pnpm/                     pnpm CLI
#   resources/runtime/primary-runtime/          interpreters + Python libraries
#   resources/icon.png                          window/taskbar icon
#
# Five details are load-bearing; each was verified experimentally against the
# unmodified upstream application.
#
#  1. The Electron binary must NOT be named 'electron'. Electron treats an
#     executable by that name as "the default app" and reports
#     app.isPackaged === false, which sends main.ts down its development branch.
#     Verified on identical trees: renamed -> isPackaged true, untouched -> false.
#
#  2. The bundled runtime lives at resources/app/dsh, not resources/dsh.
#     runtimeResources() (apps/desktop/src/main.ts) resolves the packaged path as
#     join(app.getAppPath(), 'dsh'), and upstream's electron-builder config packs
#     'dsh' *inside* the asar ({ from: dsh, to: 'dsh' }). This package ships no
#     asar, so app.getAppPath() is resources/app and the runtime sits beneath it.
#     With the runtime anywhere else the binary still starts, then dies later on
#     a missing desktop-runtime.json.
#
#  3. desktop-runtime.json is only partly validated at launch, which is why this
#     package checks it at build time instead. The reader the shipped shell runs
#     (readDesktopRuntime, inlined into lib/main.js) hard-fails unless both
#     @deepseek-ai/dsh and @deepseek-ai/dsh-desktop-host appear in sharedPackages
#     carrying exactly release.version, and unless release.nodeVersion and
#     release.pnpmVersion are semver strings. It does NOT compare
#     release.hostProtocolVersion, and it treats the 'files' inventory as
#     structural only: the byte-level integrity sweep and the protocol-generation
#     comparison both live in verifyDesktopRuntime, which upstream runs while
#     packaging and which never runs at launch. So an empty 'files' array is
#     legal (the store hash is a stronger guarantee), the protocol field is
#     informational at runtime, and a stale protocol or Node version would be
#     accepted silently. Both are therefore derived at build time (see 3a in the
#     install phase) rather than written down here.
#
#  4. Three environment details are load-bearing; the wrapper sets all three.
#     CHROME_DEVEL_SANDBOX points Chromium at its setuid sandbox helper, exactly
#     as nixpkgs' own electron wrapper does. Without it the process dies on
#     SIGILL before printing anything, and the only alternative is --no-sandbox,
#     which disables the sandbox outright. LD_LIBRARY_PATH must carry libstdc++,
#     because N-API addons are dlopen()ed out of a per-user cache directory
#     (node-addon-native-custom-loader copies them out of the store first), so
#     they do not inherit the Electron binary's RPATH; without it the Host aborts
#     with "No usable native binding found for
#     node-addon-require-builtin-linux-x64-gnu". It also carries the substituted
#     libvips directory, first, which note 5 explains.
#
#     PATH additionally carries bubblewrap, because dsh's own platform sandbox
#     probes for it first on Linux (chain: bwrap, then landlock) and refuses to
#     run a command unconfined when neither backend is usable. The landlock
#     launcher's optional platform package is not materialized by the offline
#     pnpm install, so without bwrap every workspace-write command fails with
#     SANDBOX_UNAVAILABLE and the desktop app can only ask for escalation.
#     Electron's chrome-sandbox is unrelated: it confines renderers, not the
#     commands the model runs.
#
#  5. sharp's native addon cannot run the libvips it ships with, so the package
#     substitutes a dynamically linked one. The addon
#     (node_modules/.pnpm/@img+sharp-linux-x64@*/.../sharp-linux-x64-<v>.node)
#     requires a prebuilt libvips-cpp.so.8.18.3 that statically embeds its own
#     glib: it exports ~1800 g_* symbols and has no libglib-2.0.so.0 in its
#     DT_NEEDED. Electron on Linux links a dynamically linked glib, and the
#     addon's own seven glib references (g_object_ref, g_object_unref,
#     g_signal_connect_data, g_malloc, g_free, g_log_set_handler,
#     g_utf8_validate) resolve out of the global scope, where Electron's
#     already-loaded copy is found before the libvips the addon's DT_NEEDED
#     names. So the addon calls Electron's glib on GObjects that the embedded
#     glib created, and the first raster operation dies with SIGSEGV. That is the
#     failure the desktop writes to
#     ~/.config/@deepseek-ai/dsh-desktop/logs/crash-<time>-host.log as "dsh
#     desktop host stopped", with only sharp's own [SharpElectronLinux] warning
#     on the captured stderr. Reproduced in isolation: a 4x4
#     sharp({ create }).png().toBuffer() under ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1
#     ./deepseek-harness exits 139, and preloading glib into a plain Node 24.20.0
#     makes the same pipeline exit 139 there too, while Node 24.20.0 alone exits
#     0. LD_DEBUG=bindings names the wrong library on the addon's g_object_ref
#     and g_object_unref bindings; sharp documents the same conflict under
#     "Electron and Linux" (https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install) and tracks
#     it upstream as electron#46323.
#
#     sharpLibvips therefore supplies the one thing the addon is missing: a
#     dynamically linked libvips of the same upstream version, reachable under
#     the addon's own DT_NEEDED name. The addon resolves libvips through
#     DT_RUNPATH (verified with readelf -d, not DT_RPATH), and LD_LIBRARY_PATH is
#     searched first, so exporting that directory is enough to make the addon
#     load it instead of the prebuilt library. It links glib dynamically, and the
#     loader resolves libglib-2.0.so.0 to the copy Electron already loaded, which
#     leaves one glib and one GObject type system in the process. The wrapper
#     prepends the directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Nothing in the build exercises
#     that path, so re-check it by hand after an Electron, sharp or vips bump:
#     under ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 any sharp raster operation has to exit 0,
#     where the prebuilt libvips exits 139.
#
#     vips comes from the stable input rather than pkgsUnstable because 26.05
#     carries exactly the version the addon's DT_NEEDED names. sharpLibvips reads
#     that name from the addon with patchelf and fails the build when nixpkgs'
#     vips disagrees, so a vips bump breaks the build in a place that names both
#     versions instead of segfaulting the app. The cost is vips' own runtime
#     closure (measured at 295 MB of nar, none of whose 109 paths is otherwise in
#     this package's unstable-based closure); it buys an exact C++ ABI match for
#     the prebuilt addon, which is worth more here than the closure. The prebuilt
#     libvips stays in the tree, unreferenced, because it is part of the shared
#     source package.
#
#     Two alternatives were tried and rejected. Localizing the prebuilt libvips'
#     glib symbols removes the interposition but not the crash: the addon's own
#     references then bind to Electron's glib and it still exits 139. The
#     WebAssembly build is not installed by the offline pnpm install, sharp only
#     falls back to it when the native addon fails to load, and it gives up
#     native text rendering and tiled output.
#
#  6. The window menu bar is not drawn. This is the one deliberate deviation
#     from upstream, and it changes drawing only: the application menu stays
#     installed. Linux draws that menu as a native bar across the top of every
#     window -- the localized "Application / Edit" strip. The bar carries About,
#     Check for Updates and Quit, and the Edit menu's roles; the roles have their
#     usual mouse equivalents and Quit is also on the window controls, so the
#     pointer paths it costs are About and the manual update check (scheduled
#     checks are unaffected). Removing the menu instead would cost more than the
#     bar: the Edit roles, the Quit role's Ctrl+Q and a hidden F12 devtools toggle
#     all come from that one template, and keyboard.ts toggles
#     setIgnoreMenuShortcuts against a menu it expects to exist.
#     hide-menu-bar.patch therefore wraps the bundled refreshApplicationMenu
#     instead: it hides each window's bar for the windows that exist each time
#     the menu is (re)built, and, through one 'browser-window-created' hook, for
#     every window created afterwards. The menu and each window's visibility flag
#     are main-process state, so the renderer and the Host observe nothing else.
#     The hunk is applied by appLib above with the standard patch phase (the
#     `patches` mechanism), not by hand, so it carries that mechanism's -p1
#     convention and its failure mode: an upstream restructuring that breaks the
#     context stops the build instead of silently reinstating the bar. Verified by
#     screenshotting the built package under Xvfb with an isolated home: the
#     unmodified build draws the bar on its welcome window and this assembly does
#     not, while F12 still toggles devtools in both, so the menu itself survived.
